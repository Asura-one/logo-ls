## Features

This project is build to add esthetics to ls(coreutiles) command

- Over 250+ icons
- Supporting 600+ files, extensions and directories
- 16 Million, true colors supported
- Git Status Integration
- Near native speed. (thanks to Golang)
- Language agnostic binaries

This project is highly inspired by [ls(coreutiles)](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/ls-invocation.html#ls-invocation) and [color ls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls). The project tries to find a happy path between speed and aesthetics.

## Usage

All supported flags can be found by using help flag `$ logo-ls -?`. The same has been provided as [HELP.md](/HELP.md).

The project also has its manpage which can be accessed by `man logo-ls`

### Flags

Almost all flags are same as that of the classic ls command and behave similarly. The project can be used as a drop-in replacement for the ls(coreutiles)

- With `-1`: List one entry per line
- With `-a` (or) `--all` : Does not ignore entries starting with '.'
- With `-A` (or) `--almost-all` : Does not ignore entries starting with '.', except `./` and `../`
- With `-D` (or) `--git-status`: Add Git Status to the listed Files and Directory
  - *Note*: As much I would love to make this the default behavior of the command but showing git status is an intensive task and may slow (a tiny bit) the command itself. If you want you can make alias to the command with `-D` applied to it.
- With `-l`: Shows in long listing format
  other similar commands are:
  - `-o`: like `-l`, but do not list group information
  - `-g`: like `-l`, but do not list owner
  - `-G` (or) `--no-group`: in a long listing, don't print group names
- With `-R` (or) `--recursive`: list subdirectories recursively
- With `-?` (or) `--help`: print the help message
  - similar message can be found at [HELP.md](/HELP.md).
- **Sorting**: There are many sorting flags available [default is *alphabetic order*]
  - With `-t`: sort by modification time, newest first
  - With `-S`: sort by file size, largest first
  - With `-X`: sort alphabetically by entry extension
  - With `-U`: do not sort; list entries in directory order
  - With `-v`: natural sort of (version) numbers within text
  - With `-r` (or) `-reverse`: reverse order while sorting
- With `-T` (or) `--time-style=value`: set time/date format in long formats (`-l`, `-o`, `-g`). There are many options to chose from all are listed in [HELP.md](/HELP.md).
- With `-i` (or) `--disable-icon`: don't print icons of the files
- With `-c` (or) `--disable-color`: don't color icons, filenames and git status
  - *Note*: use a combination of `-ic` to print output to a file `$ logo-ls -ic > t.txt`

For all available commands see manpage or [HELP.md](/HELP.md)

### Combination of flags

This project uses [getopt](https://github.com/pborman/getopt) which is a golang variant of the classic getopt utility used in ls(coreutiles). Thus any combination of flags are possible and can be used.

### Multiple Files and Directories

You can provide multiple files and directories as command argument [default to PWD] and all will be displayed accordingly.

### Check the downloaded Resource

receive public key of the signing party

```cmd
$ gpg2 --keyid-format long --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 0x28182066bcacccb2

gpg: key 28182066BCACCCB2: "Yash Handa (logo-ls) <yashhanda7@yahoo.com>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
```

check the signature on logo-ls_SHA512sums.txt

```cmd
$ gpg2 --keyid-format long --verify logo-ls_SHA512sums.txt.sig logo-ls_SHA512sums.txt

gpg: Signature made Tue 08 Sep 2020 10:21:52 PM IST
gpg:                using RSA key D9498B225223344C0205FDF528182066BCACCCB2
gpg: Good signature from "Yash Handa (logo-ls) <yashhanda7@yahoo.com>" [ultimate]
```

A **Good** signature means that the checked file was definitely signed by the owner of the keyfile stated (if they didnâ€™t match, the signature would be reported as **BAD**)

Now use `logo-ls_SHA512sums.txt` file to verify the authenticity of the resource downloaded

```cmd
$ sha512sum -c logo-ls_SHA512sums.txt 2>&1 | grep OK

logo-ls_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz: OK
logo-ls_Linux_arm64.tar.gz: OK
logo-ls_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz: OK
logo-ls_Linux_i386.tar.gz: OK
logo-ls_Linux_armv6.tar.gz: OK
```

Note: The downloaded resources to verify and `logo-ls_SHA512sums.txt` should be in the same directory
